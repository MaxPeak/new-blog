# Self testing（自我测试）

- Are you into music?
- 你喜欢音乐吗?
- I always listen to music no matter where I am on my way to work.I'm really into rap and recently I've been listening to a lot of Drake.It's tough to choose a favorite but if I have to,I guess I'd pick Eminem just because he is a rap God.In the past,I used to go to CD stores to find new music but nowadays,I tend to use music apps or ask my friends.It helps me to relax and takes my mind off work.It can also help me learn foreign languages by listening to foreign songs.Music is important to me because it helps me through tough times.I think music is a powerful tool to express yourself and I really connect with the emotions in the lyrics of my favorite songs.
- 译：无论我在哪里上班，我总是听音乐。我真的很喜欢说唱，最近我听了很多德雷克的歌。要选一个最喜欢的歌手很难，但是如果我必须选的话，我想我会选阿姆，因为他是说唱之神。在过去，我经常去 CD 店寻找新的音乐，但现在，我倾向于使用音乐应用程序或问我的朋友。它帮助我放松，把我的注意力从工作中解放出来。它还可以通过听外国歌曲来帮助我学习外语。音乐对我很重要，因为它帮助我度过困难时期。我认为音乐是表达自我的有力工具，我真的能从我最喜欢的歌曲的歌词中感受到情感。
