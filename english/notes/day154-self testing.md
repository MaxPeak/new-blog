# Self testing（自我测试）

- Do you read much?
- 译：你阅读量大吗？
- I read every night and I love it.When I'm travelling,I won't read because I'm too tired.Generally,I'd say I read a couple of books every month.When I read I tend to choose novels or history books,I just prefer them.Although occasionally,I'll read a magazine.I think reading is wonderful because it transports you to another world.When life gets hectic,It's nice to take an afternoon to just get lost in a book but I don't always have the time.Even though I have read many books,'Educated' by Tara Westover will always be special to me because she really inspired me.It makes me think of how lucky I am,I would recommend it to anyone really.I think reading is underrated.Now,lift is much more fast paced and people choose to watch things instead.I think that it's a shame.
- 译：我每天晚上都看书，我很喜欢。当我旅行时，我不会看书，因为我太累了。一般来说，我每个月读几本书。当我阅读时，我倾向于选择小说或历史书，我只是更喜欢它们。虽然偶尔我会看杂志。我认为阅读是美妙的，因为它把你带到另一个世界。当生活变得忙碌时，花一个下午的时间沉浸在一本书中是很好的，但是我并不总是有时间。虽然我读过很多书，但塔拉·韦斯特沃的《教育改变命运》对我来说永远是特别的，因为她真的激励了我。它让我想到我是多么的幸运，我真的会向任何人推荐它。我认为阅读被低估了。现在，生活节奏快得多，人们选择看东西代替。我认为这是一种耻辱。
