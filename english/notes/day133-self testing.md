# Self testing（自我测试）

- Are you a fan of sports?
- 你喜欢运动吗?
- When I was a kid,I would play a bit of football with my friends.Aside from football,I would sometimes go for a run or practice ping pong with my Dad at the park.Nowadays,I'm super busy with work so normally I only go to the gym about once or twice a week.I really want to go more frequently but I also just don't have the time.I love basketball and I try to watch it whenever it's on TV,I also love watching tennis but I find swimming really boring.My favorite sportsperson has to be Kobe.I think he is simply incredible.I've watched many of his matches and every time,he is just amazing.I think sports are really important especially because they help keep people fit.For people who don't like to play sports,they're still important because they can be a fan or watch sports.Sports can also make people feel like part of a community.
- 译：我还是个孩子的时候，我会和我的朋友们一起踢足球。除了足球，我有时会去跑步或和我的爸爸在公园练习乒乓球。现在，我工作非常忙，所以通常我一周只去一两次健身房。我真的很想经常去，但是我就是没有时间。我喜欢篮球，只要电视上有篮球比赛，我就会去看。我也喜欢看网球比赛，不过我觉得游泳很无聊。我最喜欢的运动员是科比。我觉得他简直不可思议。我看了他的很多比赛，每一次，他都非常棒。我认为运动真的很重要，尤其是因为它们有助于保持健康。对于那些不喜欢运动的人来说，他们仍然很重要，因为他们可以成为体育迷或观看体育比赛。运动还能让人们感觉自己是社区的一部分。
