# Self testing（自我测试）

- What's your favorite occasion of the year?
- 译：一年中你最喜欢的节日是什么?
- My favorite occasion is Spring Festival because we get to celebrate family which is super special.I spend it with my family but some years not everyone can come home.It can be quite sad when people can't make it but when we're all together it's really wonderful.Usually,we'll cook together and make dumplings or decorate the house.I prefer when I get to cook but sometimes I have to do other jobs instead.I think the reason I treasure Spring Festival so much is because I get to spend quality time with my family which I feel it's a meaningful way to celebrate and be thankful.I honestly think that festivals and special occasions are very important because they're a time to be grateful for what you have.
- 译：我最喜欢的节日是春节，因为我们可以庆祝家庭，这是非常特别的。我和家人一起度过，但不是每个人都能回家。当大家不能来的时候是很难过的，但是当我们在一起的时候真的很美好。通常，我们会一起做饭，包饺子或装饰房子。我更喜欢做饭，但有时我不得不做其他工作。我想我如此珍惜春节的原因是因为我可以和我的家人一起度过宝贵的时间，我觉得这是一个有意义的方式来庆祝和感恩。老实说，我认为节日和特殊场合是非常重要的，因为对我来说，面对节日的时候我会心怀感恩之心。
