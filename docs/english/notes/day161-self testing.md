# Self testing（自我测试）

- Are you a fan of any celebrities?
- 译：你是哪个明星的粉丝吗?
- The first time I came across Jennifer Lawrence was when I watched the Hunger Games.Ever since then,I have been obsessed with her.I think that she is such an amazing actress and really inspiring.She is super convincing but also very down to earth in real life which I truly admire.Sometimes,I wish I could act just like her but I also know that if I want to be a good actor,I have to work really hard.I think it's good to look up to someone but we should be true to ourselves.Often,it may look like success brings happiness but I think we need to recognize that it can be very difficult to be a celebrity,especially because of the media.Maybe one day I will be famous but that's not very important to me.You can be successful and not be famous,perhaps it's better to not be famous because at least you have privacy.
